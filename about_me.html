  <p>My name is Brandon Apol. I was born to military parents in 1994 and have 
      ever since been a lover of travel and adventure. After graduating from 
      university in Dayton, Ohio, I moved to Alaska to teach music in 
      public elementary schools, which has allowed me to move about the state.
       I met my wife, Lydia, at a church event in South Carolina 
      ten years ago and forgot about her completely until about three years ago,
      when we reconnected and one date led to another. <br><br>
      We currently live in Fairbanks, Alaska, where I enjoy a litany of 
      activities. A few of them include: <br>
      - Outdoor things: Rock climbing, hiking, mountaineering, cross-country skiing,
      ice climbing, photography, fishing, berry picking, kayaking, general exploring
      <br>- Indoor things: I am a music teacher (I play with egg shakers with 
      little kids), and I play a lot of guitar and drums as well as some piano 
      and bass. We own an old Nintendo 64 and my wife and I play Legend of 
      Zelda, Smash Brothers etc. I cook. I read a lot. My wife works at a co-op
       grocery store and brings home some of the best fruit in Alaska. We are 
       slowly collecting a mass of local art.<br>
      - Social events: Fairbanks has a slew of breweries, two rock climbing gyms,
      but somehow only two independent coffee shops, which I regularly attend.<br>
      <br>
      I would like to be a software programmer because I like the lifestyle it 
      can give me. I want to be able to have a large family and to be able to 
      enjoy spending time with them. Working remotely as a programmer means I 
      can be in proximity to them and live on a single income. It also allows 
      for travel so we can visit family in South Carolina while also enabling 
      us to live in Alaska.
